## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Throughout this module, you’ll create a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what’s recommended to read next.

Web applications essentially all work by managing data related to “resources”. The resources that an app cares about can be just about anything: a product for sale, an uploaded photo, a review, a bit of weather data… whatever it is that gets stored in a database. When the app provides the interface to create, read, update, and delete a resource, we refer to that as a CRUD app. Over the next few labs, you will build an app that has books as a resource.
